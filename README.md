# Slider-with-Js
this is a simple slider by JavaScript 
## Preview
- this is a preview of my project using **HTML - SCSS - JaaScript**
- if you click on the arrow icons you will change between 4 pictures I have on this projects. Moreover, the dots on the bottom of the pictures shows you the index that you are in.
- I added some **transitions** to the project to be user-friendly
- I added an interval for the **Aoutamatic movement**
